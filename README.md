# School-Project---Escape-Room
In this game you have to avoid dying in different rooms. You will collect items to get through all the rooms and then try to get out without dying. Good luck!

MY VERY FIRST PROGRAM IN C ++

When I started studying to be a System Developer with a focus on IoT, 
we were given a task to make a game. 
Me and my classmate Erik had a lot of fun making our escape room game.

Do you manage to get out of our escape room?
